# CFXS Embedded C/C++ Debugger Planned Features
- Will not crash every 5-15 minutes
- Dark theme enabled by default
- Live variable/expression Watch
- STL container support in Watch window
- User definable custom data structure decoding in Watch window
- Macros and plugins for custom extended functionality [`Lua` initially, maybe `Python` later if someone asks for it]
- Some type of `VSCode` integration somehow? (at least "Open current file in `VSCode`")

# Planned Debug Probe Support
- `Segger J-Link`
- Other probes too... some time next year maybe?

# Why this project exists
When your embedded C/C++ IDE/Debugger crashes enough times a day and is just difficult to work with, you might just want to make your own debugger.  
So this is it - my own debug tool.  
The solution to all problems of IDEs/debuggers I have tested - a debugger with some IDE functionality that is actually easy to use and powerful enough for serious debugging (hopefully)
