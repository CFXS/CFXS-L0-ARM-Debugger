# Why this project exists
When your embedded C/C++ IDE/Debugger crashes enough times a day and is just difficult to work with, you might just want to make your own debugger.  
So this is it - my own debug tool.  
The solution to all problems of IDEs/debuggers I have tested - a debugger with some IDE functionality that is actually easy to use and powerful enough for serious debugging (hopefully)
